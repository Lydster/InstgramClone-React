Tasks (Day I)
There are three major container components that you'll need to implement for this project: the Search Bar, the Post Container, and the Comment Section.
At the end of Day I there will be a single instance of the Search Bar being rendered at the top of the page, as well as a Post Container and a Comment Section for every piece of mock data in the dummy-data.js file.
The root App component of your application should import the dummy data from the dummy-data.js file with import dummyData from './dummy-data'; and iterate over said data, passing each individual object as a prop to an instance of PostContainer.
Each PostContainer component will then pass the array of comments on each post object as a prop to an instance of the CommentSection component.
The CommentSection component will receive the array of comments as props and render a Comment component with the username of the poster as well as the post's text. Additionally, there should be an input box that allows users to submit a new comment for any post. We'll work on posting new comments tomorrow.
Be sure to check the Types of the data you are passing around as props in the components that will be using props to present data as DOM elements. This should be linked to your Comment component that Comment Section will render and potentially to your Post component that Post Container will render.
You are free to leverage the Bootstrap library for this project for the purposes of theming and styling. I recommend the awesome reactstrap library, which is a library of Bootstrap components that have been implemented using React, so they're really easy to just drop straight into React projects.
In addition to Bootstrap for theming, you'll want to add your own styles via CSS. To keep things organized, have the CSS file that corresponds with a component live in the same directory as the component file.




This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
